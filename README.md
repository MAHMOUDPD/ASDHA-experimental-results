# ASDHA-experimental-results
The table in this excel file contains detailed results of experiments on various benchmark test problems. 

The Algorithms are: *SDHAM* (Structured Diagonal Hessian Algorithm) is an algorithm proposed by Santos and Hassan(2018), while *ASDHA1* and *ASDHA2* (Approx. Structured Diagonal Hessian Algorithm) are our proposed algorithms.

The metrics used in the comparison and their respective description are stated as follows:

*No. Iter* = Number of Iterations. 

*DIM* = Dimensions. 

*MVP* = Matrix vector product. 

*CPU TIME* = CPU time taken. 

*Val of f* = Value of the objective at the approx. solution. 

*F* = Failure. More details about the work can be found in:
